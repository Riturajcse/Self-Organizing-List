# Self Organizing List in Go

A self-organizing list is a list that reorders its elements based on some self-organizing heuristic to improve average access time.

The aim of a self-organizing list is to improve efficiency of linear search by moving more frequently accessed items towards the head of the list. A self-organizing list achieves near constant time for element access in the best case. A self-organizing list uses a reorganizing algorithm to adapt to various query distributions at runtime.
